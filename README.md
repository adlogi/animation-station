To create an MP4 stop-motion video of your screen captures, you need to add FFmpeg:
- Inside the app directory, create `ffmpeg/mac/` or `ffmpeg/win64/` depending on your OS.
- Get the right [executable file of FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and place it in the proper directory you created in the previous step.
